### Generation of continuous and discrete random variables

1. Write a program that implements the method of forming a two-dimensional NSW with
a certain distribution (according to the option). Run statistical
research (building a histogram of vector components, calculate the point
and interval estimates, correlation coefficient, and more). Test hypotheses about
compliance of the obtained estimates of characteristics (mathematical expectation,
variance, correlation) of a random variable theoretical.
2. Write a program that implements the method of forming a two-dimensional DSV. Execute
statistical research (construction of an empirical distribution matrix,
histograms of vector components, calculate point and interval estimates,
correlation coefficient). Test hypotheses about the correspondence of the distribution law
of the obtained random variable as required. Test hypotheses about conformity
the obtained estimates of characteristics (mathematical expectation, variance,
correlation) of a random variable theoretical.

**Variant :**

**f(x, y) = 3*e^(−x−y), ∀x, y: 0 ≤ x, y ≤ ∞**
